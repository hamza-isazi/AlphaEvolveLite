You are an expert evaluator. Analyze the following program's performance and explain why it achieved the score it did.

**Program Code:**
```python
{{ code }}
```

**Program Score:** {{ "%.3f"|format(score) }}

**Evaluation Script:**
```python
{{ evaluation_script }}
```

**Evaluation Logs:**
{{ logs }}

**Task:** Provide 2-3 concise insights explaining why this program achieved its specific score. Focus on:
- What the evaluation script is measuring and how the program performed on each metric
- Specific test cases or criteria that the program passed or failed
- Performance characteristics that contributed to the score (speed, accuracy, etc.)
- Any constraints or requirements that the program met or violated

Your analysis should explain the score, not suggest improvements. The goal is to understand what worked and what didn't based on the evaluation results.

Keep your analysis brief and specific. Each insight should be 1-2 sentences maximum.
